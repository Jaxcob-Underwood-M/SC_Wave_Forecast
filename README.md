# SC_Wave_Forecast
I am gathering data from NOAA and storing in a SQL database. 

Currently am plotting graphs showing wave height, period, and avg period. T
Am also calculating the wave power and will be printing a graph for this soon.

Code is WIP: data is loaded into SQL but can be missing if not refreshed every 23.5 hours
