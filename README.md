# SC_Wave_Forecast
A 24 hour forecast that I use to determine wave power in the Santa Cruz bay

The code is WIP:

I am adding
 - Wave power estimation that scales with Height & Period
 - Addition daily % changes for Dom Period and Ave Period
 - Additional SQL Functionality (read data back, historical data, with contextual observations)
